Contributing to the New York City Building and Address Import

Repository to manage conversion code for NYC building and address import in OpenStreetMap and to deal with data problems.

File an issue here if you:

1. Would like to participate in importing data in OpenStreetMap
2. Have a question about data quality (file with links to OSM and screenshots)
3. Found a bug or have an improvement for the conversion script
