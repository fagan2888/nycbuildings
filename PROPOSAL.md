# NYC building and address import

*Proposal to import building perimeter outline and address point data by NYC DoITT City Wide GIS Services to OpenStreetMap*

## Introduction

In March 2012, New York City released all government data to the public. Of particular interest to OpenStreetMap are building perimeter outlines and address point data, both datasets are of high quality and labor intensive to collect manually. This proposal suggests a full community supported import of all NYC building and address data, reconciling overlaps with OSM data. This proposal is complementary to [changewithin](https://github.com/osmlab/changewithin) a tool used by the NYC government to detect building and address changes in OSM to drive updates to their public datasets.

*Supporters*

- Liz Barry (TBC)
- Alex Barth (TBC)
- Eric Brelsford
- Matt Greene
- Serge Wroclawski (TBC)

## Current status: review phase

Conversion scripts are in place, a process for import is defined. Both are currently being peer reviewed among the OpenStreetMap community on imports-us@openstreetmap.org and soon on imports@openstreetmap.org.

Please review:

- Data conflation
- Import process
- OSM file quality

**Before reporting issues [review issue queue for existing reports](https://github.com/osmlab/dcbuildings/issues?state=open).**

## Data and licenses

- [Address Points](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/479174/NYC/NYC_AddressPoint.zip)
- [Buildings](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Building-Perimeter-Outlines/r7fd-yd5e)

As of September 1, 2013, address points are not yet released on New York City's open data portal. Expected release date is mid September 2013. Until then they are available on [dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/479174/NYC/NYC_AddressPoint.zip).

## Import process

1. Process building+address shapefiles into election district size .osm files (done)
2. Peer review by NYC community, imports-us and imports working group (current stage)
3. Upload data by advance group of mappers (not started)
4. Based on (3) involve a larger group of mappers (not started)

### Community based

The import will be conducted in two phases. In a first pahse, a handful of mappers will start the import and get a direct feel for the intricacies of the task. This group is currently made up of Liz Barry (TBC), Alex Barth, Eric Brelsford (TBC), Matt Greene and Serge Wroclawski (TBC). Individuals who'd like to join this advance group, please open a ticket on http://github.com/osmlab/nycbuildings.

Based on findings and progress in the first phase, tasks will be opened to broader group of people kicking off with a community session in New York City in mid October.

### Upload workflow

The .osm files generated by the conversion scripts are all to be reviewed manually and then uploaded with JOSM. We will use a [tasking manager job](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Tasking_Manager) to coordinate the effort. Most users won't need to run the script, but just pick off a task from the tasking manager, which will open the right import file in JOSM.

1. Reserve an election district size area on the NYC task on tasks.openstreetmap.us
2. Open corresponding area in JOSM. This loads the relevant .osm file with buildings and addresses and downloads existing OSM data from OSM.org
3. Manually conflate duplicate buildings, addresses and attributes.
4. Run JOSM validation
5. Address validation warnings and errors
6. Upload under [a dedicated upload account per user](https://github.com/osmlab/dcbuildings/issues/18)

[Ticket describing tasking manager job to be set up](https://github.com/osmlab/nycbuildings/issues/4).

## Conversion code and converted data

We have created scripts that process NYC building and address shapefiles into
election district size .osm files. They relate addresses to buildings, concatenate
and clean up addresses and export addresses separate from buildings where
more than one address relates to a building. The script simplifies building
polygons and handles multipolygons.

- See all details in the script's [README](https://github.com/osmlab/nycbuildings).
